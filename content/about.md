# What is post j2me devs?

**post j2me devs.** is a community of developers and hackers interested in old mobile platforms, such as J2ME.

It started first as a Discord server in Feburary 2021 created by SergioFLS ~~(me! hi!!)~~. Later got bridged to Matrix due to concerns with the Discord service by the creator.

As of writing, there are 7 different chatrooms (channels on Discord):
- #general: Chat about anything J2ME related
- #developing: Questions/discussions about J2ME dev
- #modding-re: Questions/discussions about J2ME modding
- #showcase: Show your works here!
- #off-topic: Anything goes (keep it PG-13 though, please!)
- #preservation: Archival of J2ME tutorials and source code
- #other-platforms: Discussion about development for other mobile platforms (Symbian, BREW, Mophun, etc) (temporally unbridged to Matrix as the room server shat down)

## Other stuff
If this site looks outdated, that's because of two reasons:
- This site is using Mobile XHTML. Believe it or not, there are still daily dumbphone users (many of them can be found at the dedomil.net forums) who wish to develop a game, though they only have a dumbphone. Because of this, Mobile XHTML is used.
- I'm not a web developer. (Any suggestions on how to write prettier pages is welcome!)
