      <description>Setting Up the Sun Wireless Toolkit, version 2.5.2 Below are the steps I took for installing the Sun WTK, on a Windows XP virtual machine.
The virtual machine part might not be needed, though I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried this yet.
VirtualBox and Windows XP Obviously, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need an installation CD. (you should get one by your own, but if you really want a link, &amp;ldquo;WinXPProSP3x86&amp;rdquo; on IA)
You will also have to set up a new VM.</description>

      <description>What is post j2me devs? post j2me devs. is a community of developers and hackers interested in old mobile platforms, such as J2ME.
It started first as a Discord server in Feburary 2021 created by SergioFLS (me! hi!!). Later got bridged to Matrix due to concerns with the Discord service by the creator.

#general: Chat about anything J2ME related #developing: Questions/discussions about J2ME dev #modding-re: Questions/discussions about J2ME modding #showcase: Show your works here!</description>
